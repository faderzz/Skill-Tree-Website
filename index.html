        <p class = "Project_Summary">The skill tree project is about guiding people down the path of self-improvement with clear, 
            actionable challenges and goals so that they never have to feel stuck. You shouldn't need to 
            watch 100 self-improvement videos to start taking action. You should be able to slowly level up your 
            discipline through the guided challenges, whilst gathering books, guides, and resources to help you on your 
            journey exactly when you need it, from people who've walked that path before. Essentially a video game skill tree, 
            but for real life.
