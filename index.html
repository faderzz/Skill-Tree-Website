        <!--The summary section of the page-->
        <h2 class = "Summary_Title">OUR VISION</h2>
        <p class = "Project_Summary1">The skill tree project is about guiding people down the path of self-improvement with clear, 
            actionable challenges and goals so that they never have to feel stuck. You shouldn't need to 
            watch 100 self-improvement videos to start taking action.
        </p>
        <!--I split these pararaphs to create a gap between both on the landing page for readibility-->
        <p class = "Project_Summary2">You should be able to slowly level up your discipline through the guided challenges, whilst 
            gathering books, guides, and resources to help you on your journey exactly when you need it, from people who've walked 
            that path before. Essentially a video game skill tree, but for real life.
